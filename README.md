Status: Planning

### Description:
A Program that is a AI enhanced Tree Document. The Ai is instructed through chat part of interface, then the AI will be able to manage nodes and fill out nodes with appropriate data. The User is also able to manage and edit nodes. Program Loads on Open and Saves on Close. Ai will be generating text and the user will be doing the image editing. First priority is, stable with working tree document interface.

## Notes
- It will be designed to work on both, Windows 10 and Ubuntu 24.10.
- Avalonia UI for multi-platform interfaces.
- It would be nice to have both image recognition and generation.
