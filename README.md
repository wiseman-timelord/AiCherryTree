### Description:
A Program that is a AI enhanced Tree Document. The Ai is instructed through chat part of interface, then the AI will be able to manage nodes and fill out nodes with appropriate data. The User is also able to manage and edit nodes. Program Loads on Open and Saves on Close. To start with Ai will be gnerating text and the user will be doing the image editing, though it would be nice to have both image recognition and generation.
